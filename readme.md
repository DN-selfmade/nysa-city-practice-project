# Nysa Web practice project

A small web development practice project featuring my hometown, Nysa.
It's a project I'm continuing alongside my Udemy course for HTML and CSS, focusing on clean code, Git and GitHub basics, and improving my English.

## Description

This project includes:
 - An HTML page about the historical city of Nysa (Nei√üe), Poland.
 - A `.gitignore` file for VS Code configuration.
 - A cathedral JPG image shot by myself showcasing one of the main landmarks.

This is a beginner-friendly HTML and CSS project to practice and improve my web development skills.

## Goals

 - Practice HTML and CSS structure and semantics
 - Use Git and GitHub for version control

## How to Use

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DN_selfmade/nysa-practice-project.git
